# 42Philosophers Guide Structure

This guide aims to introduce new functions individually not in the context of the Dining Philosophers problem, then briefly going through the problem itself. *(Bonus not included)*

New functions will be introduced with brief inline comments. Some core ideas about the functions and the implementation are deliberately left vague or brief so as to encourage experimentation and further reading on theory. Conceptual ideas regarding Philosophers will be introduced in short code examples which may be left intentionally incomplete/incorrect for you to fix!
